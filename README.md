# Jose Garcia Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio of projects! 
- I am in my last semester of my master's program in Data Analytics at George Washington Universtiy.
- I have created this website to showcase projects I have worked cleaning, visualizing, analyzing and modelling data.
- I am a python enthusiast, and currently working on speech to sign language translation as my final Capstone Project

## Sign Language Translation 

This project is my final Capstone Project to complete my master's program at George Washington University.
....under development

## Forecasting Energy Demand in a Smart Home with LSTM networks
- This is a group project in the EMSE 6575-Applied Machine Learning class at GWU. We implemented LSTM Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithm for parameters optimization. Our goal was to forecast energy demand of a smart-home.
- Matching electricity consumption with the right supply level is crucial to achieve energy efficiency in residential buildings, and avoid grid overloading and energy waste. This work focuses on achieving accurate machine learning models to forecast energy demand in a smart home. 
To do so, a time-series ['Smart Home Dataset with weather Information'](https://www.kaggle.com/taranvee/smart-home-dataset-with-weather-information) data set from Kaggle was analyzed. 


## Predicting Solar Energy production from weather parameters
- I have always been interested in clean energy and its intersection with data science and machine learning. Thus, in my first Data Analytics class I decided to train a  machine learning model to predict solar energy generation from weather data. Moreover, I learnt and used Spark to apply data analysis in large-scale distributed data processing architecture.
