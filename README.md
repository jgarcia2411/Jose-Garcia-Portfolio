## Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio 
This is a colection of some my favorite projects I have been working during my master's program in Data Analytics at George Washington University. 
Here you will find projects related to implementing machine learning in the areas of energy forecast, computer vision, neural machine translation, and natural language processing. I am a sport enthusiast who practice running, biking, climbing, and hiking. I love music, food and traveling! You can learn more about my journey in this [medium post](https://medium.com/@garciaguerra.jl/my-journey-from-petroleum-engineering-to-data-science-a7f05919d406). All my projects can be found in my [Github repository](https://github.com/jgarcia2411)

Forecasting electricity demand and consumption is critical for energy companies. It provides accurate tools for resource management, investment portfolio, power consumption and usage planning, scheduling, and network distribution analysis. Modern buildings are also benefitted from consumption forecasts, and more buildings are adopting new technologies to generate usage data. Thus, it is evident that accurate models are growing in demand over multiple modern residences. This class project focused on analyzing data from a residential building and developing machine learning models to forecast energy demand using historical consumption data, and weather recordings. 

Project Highlights
-	Forecast power demand of the next day given the previous seven days of power consumption. 
-	Implemented RNN-LSTM network architecture
- Model hyper-parameters optimized with genetic algorithms

*In collaboration with Chi-Yun and Quing Zhu*
This ongoing project is my final Capstone Project to complete the MS Data Analytics program at George Washington University. The goal of this project is to implement different neural networks architectures to translate American Sign Language videos to English. Currently, this projects implements Encoder-Decoder model architecture.

The amount of energy produced by solar panels depends on the efficiency of the panel, its orientation towards the sun, and the weather. Companies are interested to understand how production is impacted by different weather scenarios. This class project was developed to understand which of the different weather parameters affects solar energy production. Additionally, given a set of weather informatin, what is the ammount of energy expected to be produced?

Project highlights:
-	Project implementation in Spark, and MLflow
-	Decision Tree best prediction metrics: RMSE = 3412, R-squared = 0.92

More people is getting interested in tracking the number of calories on their food, and creating awareness to what we eat each day. Counting calories can help people to identify eating patterns that might affect our health. Thus, this tool was created to predict the number of calories and classify the cuisine type from a given recipe. In this group project, we used around 40k recipes to train machine learning models. Finally, the models are deployed in an interactive app hosted in [**Streamlit**](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py) 

Project highlights:
-	Natural Language Processing implementation to clean recipes data
-	Random Forst best prediction metric: RMSE = 196
-	Support Vector Classifier best classification metrics: ACCURACY = 0.79

## [Creating a SQL Database](https://github.com/jgarcia2411/Zomato_SQL_Database.git)
![zomato](/images/zomato.png)

*In collaboration with Kahang Ngau*
The goal of this class project is to restructure a flattened dataset, and load into a SQL database, demonstrate the convenience to have this dataset stored in a database, and provide an efficient and easier way for end-users to search for specific information. Zomato is a project launched in Delhi 12 years ago, and is present in 10000+ cities globally. Zomato is one of the 'largest food aggregators in the world' and their mission is to connect people to food.
