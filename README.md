# Data Science Portfolio 
- Two years ago while working as a Reservoir Engineer in the oil industry, I found a true call for Analytics, Data Science and Machine Learning. Then, I decided to go back to school and start the Master of Science in Data Analytics program at George Washington University.
- Through my coursework, I have developed skills in data processing, data visualization, machine learning and computer vision. In this portfolio of school projects I have showcased the projects I enjoyed to most. 
- Outside school and work, I am a sport enthusiast who practice running, biking, climbing, and hiking. I love music, food and traveling! You can learn more about my journey in this [medium post](https://medium.com/@garciaguerra.jl/my-journey-from-petroleum-engineering-to-data-science-a7f05919d406).
- All my projects can be found in my [Github repository](https://github.com/jgarcia2411)

Forecasting electricity demand and consumption is critical for energy companies. It provides accurate tools for resource management, investment portfolio, power consumption and usage planning, scheduling, and network distribution analysis. Modern buildings are also benefitted from consumption forecasts, and more buildings are adopting new technologies to generate usage data. Thus, it is evident that accurate models are growing in demand over multiple modern residences. This class project focused on analyzing data from a residential building and developing machine learning models to forecast energy demand using historical consumption data, and weather recordings. 

Project Highlights
-	Long-short-term memory neural networks implementation
- Model optimization with genetic algorithms

This ongoing project is my final Capstone Project to complete the MS Data Analytics program at George Washington University. The goal of this project is to implement different neural networks architectures to translate American Sign Language videos to English. Currently, after an extensive literature review in the sign language processing research area, we are implementing Encoder-Decoder with Attention architecture.

## Applying Machine Learning to predict Solar Energy production capacity in a power plant

Solar energy is a renewable source promised to be a crucial part of the future energy grid. Since it is dependent on weather, companies are interested to understand the impact on energy production under different weather scenarios. Additionally, solar energy can’t be cost-efficiently stored, hence forecasting its capacity is increasingly valuable to electric power system operators. Therefore, this class project was developed to understand which weather parameters influence energy production in a solar farm, and how much energy is expected to produce given current weather. In this project, I merged and analyzed solar farm energy production and weather data. I trained machine learning models and predicted power supply given weather data. 

Project highlights:
-	Machine learning implementation in Spark
-	Decision Tree best prediction metrics: RMSE = 3412, R-squared = 0.92

More people is getting interested in tracking the number of calories on their food, and creating awareness to what we eat each day. Counting calories can help people to identify eating patterns that might affect our health. Thus, this tool was created to predict the number of calories and classify the cuisine type from a given recipe. In this group project, we used around 40k recipes to train machine learning models. Finally, the models are deployed in an interactive app hosted in [**Streamlit**](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py) 

Project highlights:
-	Natural Language Processing implementation to clean recipes data
-	Random Forst best prediction metric: RMSE = 196
-	Support Vector Classifier best classification metrics: ACCURACY = 0.79

## [Creating a SQL Database](https://github.com/jgarcia2411/Zomato_SQL_Database.git)
![zomato](/images/zomato.png)
The goal of this class project is to restructure a flattened dataset, and load into a SQL database, demonstrate the convenience to have this dataset stored in a database, and provide an efficient and easier way for end-users to search for specific information. Zomato is a project launched in Delhi 12 years ago, and is present in 10000+ cities globally. Zomato is one of the 'largest food aggregators in the world' and their mission is to connect people to food.
