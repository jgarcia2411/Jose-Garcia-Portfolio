# School Projects

## Forecasting Energy Demand in a residential building with LSTM neural networks and Genetic Algorithms

Forecasting electricity demand and consumption is critical for energy companies. It provides accurate tools for resource management, investment portfolio, power consumption and usage planning, scheduling, and network distribution analysis. Modern buildings are also benefitted from consumption forecasts, and more buildings are adopting new technologies to generate usage data. Thus, it is evident that accurate models are growing in demand over multiple modern residences. This class project focused on analyzing data from a residential building and developing machine learning models to forecast energy demand using historical consumption data, and weather recordings. 

Highlights of this project includes:
-	Long-short-term memory neural networks implementation
-	Network architecture optimization with genetic algorithms
-	Metrics coming soon......re-training model.
-	You can find Github repository: [here](https://github.com/jgarcia2411/Energy-Supply-Smart-Home.git)
-	You can iterate over the steps: [Medium post comming soon......]()

## Predicting Cuisine type and calories from a given recipe
More people is getting interested to track the number of calories on their food, and to create awareness to what we eat each day. Counting calories can help people identify eating patterns that might affect our health. Thus, this tool was created to predict the number of calories and classify the cuisine type from a given recipe. In this group project, we used around 40k recipes to train machine learning models. Finally, the models are deployed in an interactive app hosted in [**Streamlit**](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py) 

Project highlights:
-	Natural Language Processing implementation to clean data 
-	Support vector machine, classification model had best results
-	Random Forst best prediction metric: RMSE = 196
-	Support Vector Classifier best classification metrics: ACCURACY = 0.79 
-	You can find Github repository: [here](https://github.com/jgarcia2411/emse-6574-final-project.git)
-	You can iterate over jupyter notebook: [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/msalceda/msalceda.github.io/blob/master/assets/emse6574_assignments/EMSE_6574_Final_Project.ipynb)
-	You can use interactive streamlit app: [here](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py)

## Predicting Solar Energy production from weather parameters
Solar energy is a renewable source promised to be a crucial part of the future energy grid. Since it is dependent on weather, companies are interested to understand the impact on energy production under different weather scenarios. Additionally, solar energy can’t be cost-efficiently stored, hence forecasting its capacity is increasingly valuable to electric power system operators. Therefore, this class project was developed to understand which weather parameters influence energy production in a solar farm, and how much energy is expected to produce given current weather. In this project, I merged and analyzed solar farm energy production and weather data. I trained machine learning models and predicted power supply given weather data. 

Project highlights:
-	Machine learning implementation in parallel distributed system – Spark
-	Model deployment with MLflow and Streamlit (coming soon....)
-	Decision Tree best prediction metrics: RMSE = 3412, R-squared = 0.92
-	Notebook of this project can be found: [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/msalceda/msalceda.github.io/blob/master/assets/emse6574_assignments/Week_2_Assignment_Michael_Salceda.ipynb)

## Zomato Database
The goal of this class project is to restructure a flattened dataset, and load into a SQL database, demonstrate the convenience to have this dataset stored in a database, and provide an efficient and easier way for end-users to search for specific information. Zomato is a project launched in Delhi 12 years ago, and is present in 10000+ cities globally. Zomato is one of the 'largest food aggregators in the world' and their mission is to connect people to food.
