About me:
- I am in my last semester of the master's program in Data Analytics at George Washington Universtiy.
- This portfolio showcase projects where I have gathered data, cleaned, visualized and modelled.
- Most of my projects are energy related since I am familiar with the field, but I am also exploring new fields of applications
- I am a python enthusiast, and currently working on speech to sign language translation as my final Capstone Project

## Predicting Cuisine type and calories from a given recipe
- This project is one of the first machine learning projects I have worked on. In the EMSE 6574-Programming for Analytics class, we developed this ML project to predict the cuisine type and the number of calories by entering any recipe. 
- To train the models, we used data from the Kaggle's competition [What's Cooking](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/data)
- Finally we deployed our models in [**Streamlit**](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py)
- Coding notebooks can be found [**here**](https://nbviewer.org/github/msalceda/msalceda.github.io/blob/master/assets/emse6574_assignments/EMSE_6574_Final_Project.ipynb) 
- Github repo can be found [**here**]()

## Forecasting Energy Demand in a Smart Home with LSTM networks
- This is a group project in the EMSE 6575-Applied Machine Learning class at GWU. We implemented LSTM Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithm for parameters optimization. Our goal was to forecast energy demand of a smart-home.
- Matching electricity consumption with the right supply level is crucial to achieve energy efficiency in residential buildings, and avoid grid overloading and energy waste. This work focuses on achieving accurate machine learning models to forecast energy demand in a smart home. 
To do so, a time-series ['Smart Home Dataset with weather Information'](https://www.kaggle.com/taranvee/smart-home-dataset-with-weather-information) data set from Kaggle was analyzed.

## Predicting Solar Energy production from weather parameters
- My interest in clean energy and its intersection with data science has driven me to work on this project.
- In this project, I trained machine learning models to predict solar energy generation from weather parameters.
- The implementation of this project has been done in Spark taking advantage of its capabilities to parrallel distribute data, manage models with MLflow libraries, and deploy models with streaming deployment.
