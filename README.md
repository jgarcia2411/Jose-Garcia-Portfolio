About me:
- I am in my last semester of the master's program in Data Analytics at George Washington Universtiy. This portfolio showcase my school projects in the different courses I have taken: Programming for Analytics, Applied Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Database Management. I got involved analyzing mostly energy usage and consumption data sets since I have been interested in this field.

# School Projects

## Forecasting Energy Demand in a Smart Home with LSTM networks

Forecasting electricity demand and consumption is critical for energy companies. It provides accurate tools for resource management, investments, power consumption and usage planning, scheduling, and network distribution analysis. Modern buildings are also benefitted from consumption forecasts, and more buildings are adopting new technologies to generate usage data. Thus, it is evident that accurate models are growing in demand over multiple modern residences. This class project focused on analyzing data from a residential building and developing machine learning models to forecast energy demand using historical consumption data, and weather recordings. Highlights of this project includes:
-	Long-short-term memory neural networks implementation
-	Network architecture optimization with genetic algorithms
-	### metrics performance to forecast xxx steps
-	You can find Github repository: [here]()
-	You can iterate over the steps: [here]()

## Predicting Cuisine type and calories from a given recipe
- This project is one of the first machine learning projects I have worked on. In the EMSE 6574-Programming for Analytics class, we developed this ML project to predict the cuisine type and the number of calories by entering any recipe. 
- To train the models, we used data from the Kaggle's competition [What's Cooking](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/data)
- Finally we deployed our models in [**Streamlit**](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py)
- Coding notebooks can be found [**here**](https://nbviewer.org/github/msalceda/msalceda.github.io/blob/master/assets/emse6574_assignments/EMSE_6574_Final_Project.ipynb) 
- Github repo can be found [**here**]()

## Predicting Solar Energy production from weather parameters
- My interest in clean energy and its intersection with data science has driven me to work on this project.
- In this project, I trained machine learning models to predict solar energy generation from weather parameters.
- The implementation of this project has been done in Spark taking advantage of its capabilities to parrallel distribute data, manage models with MLflow libraries, and deploy models with streaming deployment.
