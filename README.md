# Portfolio

## Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio 
Here you will find a collection of projects I worked on while pursuing my Master's program in [Data Analytics](https://graduate.seas.gwu.edu/masters-data-analytics) at George Washington University. Through these projects, I learned and applied concepts in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. 


## About me
I am a **Data Analyst and Engineer.** I strongly believe data is one of the most valuable assets to unlock challenges across industries and help businesses make better decisions. After working as a **Petroleum Engineer** for 2 years in my home country Ecuador, I moved to the United States following my passion to learn new things and pursued a **Master of Science degree in Data Analytics at George Washington University**.

Currently, I am volunteering on the [SDG Data Catalog Project](https://ai4good.org/what-we-do/sdg-data-catalog/) at the **AI for Good Foundation** as ML Developer. My role involves developing and evaluating multivariate classification models for name entity recognition tasks. 

Outside of work, I practice climbing, hiking and running. These activities give me the mentality to always go outside my confort zone and challenge myself.

*In collaboration with Chi-Yun and Quing Zhu*

In this Capstone project, we implemented **Convolution 3D** and **Encoder-Decoder** neural network architectures to build models to detect and translate American Sign Language - ASL - from short videos. 
- Processed video data from [How2Sign](https://how2sign.github.io/) database and TikTok.
- Built Convolution 3D model with 95% accuracy.
- Extracted pose, hands and face features with [MediPipe Holistic](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/holistic.html)
- Implemented Encoder-Decoder + Attention architecture.

Power demand forecast provides accurate tools for resource management, investment portfolio, and electric consumption planning across residential and industrial buildings. Modern buildings invest in energy tracking sensors and IoT devices to streamline building data and optimize resource consumption. Thus, the need to collect and analyze building data increases over time. In this class project we:

-	Forecasted power demand for the next day given the previous seven days of power consumption. 
-	**Implemented RNN-LSTM** network architecture.
- Optimized hyper-parameters by implementing **genetic algorithms**

Over the last years, the growing interest in renewable energy has pushed energy companies to increase renewable energy assets around the globe. Contrary to traditional energy resources such as oil & gas and coal, solar energy generation is affected by meteorological conditions. Thus, companies look to develop a better understanding on those meteorological conditions that impact photovoltaic panels. This class project looks to understand which of the different meteorological condition influence on solar power generation by analyzing data collected from a [photovoltaic plant]() in California and the [National Solar Radiation Database](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/).

Tracking the number of calories in food is important to create awareness  of what we eat every day. Counting calories can help people identify eating patterns that might affect their health. Thus, in this project we built a tool to predict the number of calories and classify the cuisine type from a given recipe. We used 40k recipes to train machine learning models and deployed them in [**Streamlit**](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py) 

-	Implemented **Natural Language Processing** to clean text
-	Built a cusine type classification model with an **accuracy of 79%** using Support Vector Classifiers
-	Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict the number of calories
-	Model deployment with [**Streamlit**](https://share.streamlit.io/msalceda/emse-6574-final-project/main/final_project_app.py)
